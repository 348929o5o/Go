How to play:
-Game automatically saves/creates a save with the name goSave.txt, to start a new game, delete the contents of this file, if not present, skip to the next step
-In Go, the goal is to “occupy” as much territory as possible by surrounding the area. You can destroy enemy pieces by making sure they touch no open space, and vice versa. Most games of Go end when both player pass twice when none of them can improve their position by placing pieces, but the AI in the game is not advanced enough to do this, so simply count the pieces surrounded to get the score
-For this game, you are allowed to place in any unoccupied space even if it was previously surrounded. This can be useful to reduce an opponent's occupied territory by forcing them to surround you again
-You will always start as black
-To place a piece, simply click on the area you want to place a piece.
-If you want to continue a previous game, do not delete the goSave.txt file or its contents
-Any Space with a peice DOES NOT COUNT towards your occupied space, if you fill out every gap you get a tie
